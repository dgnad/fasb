# fasb

Implementation of the **f**aceted **a**nswer **s**et **b**rowser, introduced in https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20506.

fasb is a REPL system implemented on top of the [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) solver.
It enables answer set navigation alongside quantitative reasoning.

## web tool

A prototypical web application of fasb can be found
[here](https://drwadu.github.io/web-fasb.github.io/). Its implementation is
very basic and not considered stable by any means. The compiled command line
tool is more efficient & provides more functionality.

## fundamental concepts

**weight of facet**

The weight of a facet is the amount by which a specified quantity changes due
to activating this facet. More on weights of facets can be found in
https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i5.20506.

**significance of a facet for a literal**

To ask how significant a facet `f` is for a literal `l`, conceptionally,
corresponds to asking how much information we gain (dually, uncertainty we
reduce) among answer sets that satisfy `l` when filtering those answer sets
that satisfy `l` and `f`. More on the notion of significance can be found in
https://doi.org/10.24963/kr.2024/60.

**representative answer sets**

fasb also implements a basic method for compressing a huge amount of answer
sets into representative ones. More on representative answer sets can be found
in https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/FAIA230280.

## quickstart

fasb as a REPL:

```
$ fasb program.lp 0
fasb v0.1.2
:: ! 2         -- enumerate up to 2 answer sets
solution 1:
a e
solution 2:
b d e
found 2
:: ?           -- query facets
b d c a
:: #!!         -- query weights based on answer set counting
0.3333 2 b     -- [reduces answer set count by] [remaining answer sets] [facet]
0.6667 1 d
0.3333 2 ~d
0.6667 1 c
0.3333 2 ~c
0.6667 1 a
0.3333 2 ~a
:: ' max#f     -- use facet-counting strictly goal-oriented mode
:: $$          -- perform step (causing highest uncertainty reduction)
1.0000 0 d     -- activated facet `d` (reduced facet count by 100%)
:: @           -- query current route
d
:: !           -- enumerate all answer sets under current route
solution 1:
b d e
found 1
:: --          -- clear route
:: #!          -- query answer set count
3
:: > a|b&c|d   -- declare cnf query: (a or b) and (c or d)
:: >           -- clear query
:: % e ^*      -- compute significance of each current facet for literal e
 inc   exc
1.000 0.250 d
1.000 0.500 a
1.000 0.250 c
0.500 1.000 b
:: :q          --  quit
```

fasb as an interpreter:

```
$ cat script.fsb
! 1                  -- output 1 answer set
#?                   -- query facet count
\ != #f 0 | $$ . ! 2 -- while condition | command . command
@                    -- display route
$ fasb program.lp 0 srcipt.fsb
fasb v0.1.2
:: ! 1
solution 1:
a e
found 1
:: #?
8
:: \ != #f 0 | $$ . ! 2
_ _ b
solution 1:
b d e
solution 2:
b c e
found 2
_ _ c
solution 1:
b c e
found 1
:: @
b c
```

## install

1. [install cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
2. `cargo install fasb`

## build

1. [install cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
2. `cd fasb && cargo build -r`

## usage

`fasb program [clingo flags] [script]`

Apart from being a REPL system, fasb can also be used as an interpreter of
instructions, which will be performed line by line. To use fasb as an
interpreter add the feature flag `--feature interpreter` when installing or
building. When using the interpreter, provide a script.

The designated syntax for regular expressions (regex) can be found
[here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).


### commands

Run fasb and type command `man` to see a palette of commands.

### parameters

- `--f` suppresses facet computation at startup
- `--l` prints true and false atoms at startup
- `--cache` enables the facet cache
- `--optimized` enables optimized internal computation paths
- `--fast` enables both `--cache` and `--optimized`

### performance modes

| Mode | fasb flags | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | none | Uses the regular computation paths without the facet cache |
| Cache | `--cache` | Reuses facet computations for previously visited routes |
| Optimized | `--optimized` | Uses optimized internal computation paths without enabling the cache |
| Fast | `--fast` | Combines the cache and optimized computation paths |

There is no separate `--baseline` flag. To run the baseline, omit `--cache`,
`--optimized`, and `--fast`:

```console
# Baseline
fasb program.lp 0

# Cache only
fasb program.lp 0 --cache

# Cache and optimized paths
fasb program.lp 0 --fast
```

The same flags work in interpreter mode, where the script path remains last:

```console
fasb program.lp 0 --fast script.fsb
```

The cache holds up to 128 entries by default. Its state and the optimized paths
can also be controlled while fasb is running:

```text
cache status
cache on
cache off
cache clear
cache size 256
optimization status
optimization on
optimization off
```

The aliases `:cache` and `:opt` remain available for compatibility.

## Python bindings

1. [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. build the extension module and set up the environment: `uv sync`
3. run anything in that environment with `uv run`:

```console
uv run python -c "import fasb; fasb.start_fasb([], 'your_lp_file.lp', True, False)"
uv run your_script.py
```

After editing the Rust sources, rebuild with `uv sync --reinstall-package fasb`.

Currently you can use and import following (sub)modules:

```python
import fasb # lib.rs
from fasb import interpreter_bindings # interpreter.rs
from fasb import wrappers_bindings # wrappers.rs
```

You can start fasb directly by using two distinct function:

```python
# interpreter mode
from fasb import start_fasb_interpreter

# REPL mode
from fasb import start_fasb
```

Instead of starting a REPL you can drive a navigator directly. The second
argument of `PyNavigator` is the clingo argument list, so clingo flags and
constants are passed through here:

```python
from fasb import interpreter_bindings as ib
from fasb import wrappers_bindings as wb

program = open("test/blocks.lp").read()
# "0" enumerates all models; -c horizon=12 overrides the #const in the program.
nav = wb.PyNavigator(program, ["0", "-c", "horizon=12"])

route = []                                  # empty route: the whole search space
facets = ib.compute_facets(nav, route, [])
ib.facet_count(facets)                       # `count`  / `#?`
ib.answer_set_count(nav, route, [])          # `solvecount` / `#!`
ib.facet_counts(nav, facets, route, [])      # `counts` / `#??`
```

The functions in `interpreter_bindings` mirror the REPL commands and print to
stdout from Rust. When you interleave them with Python `print`, flush the Python
side (`print(..., flush=True)`) or the output arrives out of order.

`test/navigate_plan_space.py` is a runnable example: it reports the facet count,
the plan count and the significance of every facet for a planning problem
(`test/blocks.lp`, a blocksworld instance, by default).

```console
uv run test/navigate_plan_space.py --horizon 12 test/blocks.lp
```

## Scripting (interpreter mode)

The interpreter executes one fasb command per line. Lines beginning with `//`
are comments. Build or install fasb with the Cargo feature `interpreter`:

```console
# Build from this repository
cargo build --release --features interpreter

# Or install from crates.io
cargo install fasb --features interpreter
```

Create a script, for example:

```text
// Inspect the initial state
solve 1
count

// Navigate until no facets remain
while #facets != 0 do step; solve 2
route
```

Then execute it. Clingo and fasb flags go before the script path:

```console
fasb program.lp 0 --fast script.fsb
```

### loops

A loop has the following form:

```text
while <variable> <operator> <number> do <command>; <command>; ...
```

Supported variables are `#facets` (the current number of facets) and `#route`
(the current route length). Supported operators are `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, and
`<=`. Multiple commands in the loop body are separated by `;`.

```text
while #facets != 0 do step; facets
while #route < 3 do step; route
```
